1. How to check firewall status in RHEL 7.4

# systemctl status firewalld

2. How to check all the active zones and active services.

# firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
# firewall-cmd --get-services

3. How to install GUI package 

# yum install firewalld firewall-config

4. Linux firewall and list all active services, ports, rich rules for public zone using following command.

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-all

	How to add, remove and modify rules in Firewall 
=======================================================
1. To open any port for public zone, use the following command. For example, the following command will open port 80 for public zone.

# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=80/tcp

2. Similarly, to remove added port, just use the ‘–remove‘ option with firewalld command as shown below.

 #firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8101/tcp
		OR
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-port=80/tcp

3. After adding or removing specific ports, make sure to confirm whether the port is added or removed by using ‘–list-ports‘ option.

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports

		How to Adding and Removing Services in Firewalld
======================================================================
1. How to check service list status in Firewall

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-services

2. How to Add service in Firewall

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=ftp

3. How to remove service from firewall

# firewall-cmd --zone=public --remove-service=ftp

		Block Incoming and Outgoing Packets (Panic Mode)
================================================================
1. If you wish to block any incoming or outgoing connections, you need to use a ‘panic-on‘ mode to block such requests.


		Masquerading IP Address
	===================================
1. How to check External zone enable or not

# firewall-cmd --zone=external --query-masquerade

2. If it’s not enabled, you can enable it by following command.

# firewall-cmd --zone=external --add-masquerade

3. Now let’s forward all ssh port 22 connections to port 2222 for IP address 192.168.0.132.

# firewall-cmd --zone=external --add-forward-port=port=22:proto=tcp:toport=2222:toaddr=192.168.0.132
# firewall-cmd --zone=external --list-all

Configuration files
Configuration files for firewalld exist in two directories:
/usr/lib/firewalld: Contains default configuration files. Do not make changes to these files. An upgrade of the firewalld package overwrites this directory.
/etc/firewalld: Changes to the default configuration files are stored in this directory.Files in this directory overload the default configuration files.

firewalld zones
The firewalld service allows you to separate networks into different zones based on the level of trust you want to place on the devices and traffic within a specific network. For each zone you can define the following features:
Services: Predefined or custom services to trust. Trusted services are a combination of ports and protocols that are accessible from other systems and networks.
Ports: Additional ports or port ranges and associated protocols that are accessible from other systems and networks.
Masquerading: Translate IPv4 addresses to a single external address. With masquerading enabled, addresses of a private network are mapped to and hidden behind a public address.
Port Forwarding: Forward inbound network traffic from a specific port or port range to an alternative port on the local system, or to a port on another IPv4 address.
ICMP Filter: Block selected Internet Control Message Protocol messages.
Rich Rules: Extend existing firewalld rules to include additional source and destination addresses and logging and auditing actions.
Interfaces: Network interfaces bound to the zone. The zone for an interface is specified with the ZONE=option in the /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg file. If the option is missing, the interface is bound to the default zone.
